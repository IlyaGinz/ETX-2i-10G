Hi Jonee, how are you?
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:29
we are trying to test the fresh units of 10G
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:29
I'm fine, how about you?
Ilya Ginzburg 08:30
i'm fine too, thank you.
I see. ..
Ilya Ginzburg 08:30
Do a product already finished a test, no matter Fail or Pass?
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:31
already finished but failed
Ilya Ginzburg 08:31
i'm checking out log system
Ilya Ginzburg 08:32
finished as PASS?
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:32
Is the testing for single and dual fan board the same?
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:32
The one that PASSED is the Golden Sample
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:33
The Golden Sample is dual fan
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:34
while the fresh units that we are producing are single fan only
Ilya Ginzburg 08:34
Regarding the FANs. What do you mean?
Regarding the pass units. I mean a new unit/s, not a golden sample
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:35
The Golden Sample is dual fan
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:35
while the fresh units that we are producing are single fan only
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:35
Our fresh units are FAILED as you can see now.
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:36
both units failed
Ilya Ginzburg 08:37
The Tester's program tests a device according to it's name (ETX-2I-10G-B_C/19/DR/8P). The name contains info about qty of fans
Ilya Ginzburg 08:40
I want to show you some instrument  which can help me to help you to understand a problem
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:40
ok, please share with me
Ilya Ginzburg 08:41
go to GUI's File menu
Ilya Ginzburg 08:42
File -> Console -> Capture Console
Ilya Ginzburg 08:42
go to C:\temp
Ilya Ginzburg 08:45
you see the "screenshot" of the Console. If you send me the file I can see what happened after LAST click on the RUN button. It cat give me a hint what may be the problem source
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:47
what do you mean?
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:49
what file?
Ilya Ginzburg 08:50
OK. When the Tester is running, I put to the Console (let say, a debug window) some info about the testing process. Each time you press the RUN (green) button, I clear the Console. When you Capture the Console I copy its content to a txt file
Ilya Ginzburg 08:50
ConsoleCapt_2022.03.30_08.42.txt, for example
Ilya Ginzburg 08:51
I created a new file right now
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:51
ok, now i understand
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:51
I will try to retest both UUTs?
Ilya Ginzburg 08:52
So, if I can't to connect to the Tester, lets say, on weekend , you can create a copy of the Console and send me by email
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:52
ok, noted
Ilya Ginzburg 08:53
no, lets perform a manual test
Ilya Ginzburg 08:53
i will open a terminal program and turn off-on the unit under test
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 08:55
ok, i see
Ilya Ginzburg 08:58
the product is stack . I think you should send an email to Ronen.B (ETX-2i10G team leader) about the issue and include the Inventory and Page screenshots. I will show you
Ilya Ginzburg 09:03
copy these file to your PC/laptop and ask Ronen for a help. CC my name
AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 09:03

AT-2I10G-11-W10-Philippines 09:03
